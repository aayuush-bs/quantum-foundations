# Quantum Foundations

This repository documents my study of the mathematical and conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics.

The focus is on:
- Linear algebra and Hilbert space methods
- Operator formalism and commutators
- Core quantum mechanics principles from first principles
- Clear derivations, not rote formulas

This repository is part of my long-term Quantum Mastery Project (IIT Jodhpur → IISc).

## Structure
- `linear-algebra/` — vector spaces, operators, eigenvalue problems  
- `mathematical-physics/` — Fourier methods, PDE tools for QM  
- `quantum-mechanics/` — operators, states, angular momentum  

## Standards
- Every notebook includes theory, derivations, and interpretation  
- Code is used only where it adds insight  
- Notes are written to be readable by another serious student

## Status
Work in progress. Updated continuously.
